# 24/7 Screen & Audio Capture

Library to build personalized AI powered by what you've seen, said, or heard. Works with Ollama. Alternative to Rewind.ai. Open. Secure. You own your data. Rust.  
We are shipping daily, make suggestions, post bugs, [give feedback](mailto:louis@screenpi.pe?subject=Screenpipe%20Feedback&body=I'd%20like%20to%20use%20Screenpipe%20for%20...%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20cannot%20because%20of%20...%0D%0A%0D%0AWe%20can%20also%20have%20a%20call,%20book%20at%20https://cal.com/louis030195/screenpipe).

# Why?

Building a reliable stream of audio and screenshot data, where a user simply clicks a button and the script runs in the background 24/7, collecting and extracting data from screen and audio input/output, can be frustrating. 

There are numerous use cases that can be built on top of this layer. To simplify life for other developers, we decided to solve this non-trivial problem. It's still in its early stages, but it works end-to-end. We're working on this full-time and would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.

## Getting started

Struggle to get it running? [I'll install it with you in a 15 min call.](https://cal.com/louis030195/screenpipe)

<details>
  <summary>BACKEND</summary>


<details>
  <summary>MacOS</summary>

<details>
  <summary>Option I: Library</summary>

⚠️ You need to build from source if you have an Intel mac

1. Navigate to the folder where you want the data to be stored

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
brew install pkg-config
brew install ffmpeg
brew install jq
```
3. Install library
```bash
brew tap louis030195/screen-pipe https://github.com/louis030195/screen-pipe.git
brew install screenpipe
```
4. Run it:
```bash
screenpipe 
```
or if you don't want audio to be recorded
```bash
screenpipe --disable-audio
```
if you want to save OCR data to text file in text_json folder in the root of your project (good for testing):
```bash
screenpipe --save-text-files
```
if you want to run screenpipe in debug mode to show more logs in terminal:
```bash
screenpipe --debug
```

you can combine multiple flags if needed

<details>
  <summary>Option II: Install from the source</summary>

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
brew install pkg-config

brew install jq
```

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/louis030195/screen-pipe
```

This runs a local SQLite DB + an API + screenshot, ocr, mic, stt, mp4 encoding
```bash
cd screen-pipe # enter cloned repo
```

```bash
cargo build --release --features metal
```

Sign the executable to avoid mac killing the process when it's running for too long
```bash
codesign --sign - --force --preserve-metadata=entitlements,requirements,flags,runtime ./target/release/screenpipe
```

Then run it
```bash
./target/release/screenpipe # add "--disable-audio" if you don't want audio to be recorded
# "--save-text-files" if you want to save OCR data to text file in text_json folder in the root of your project (good for testing)
# "--debug" if you want to run screenpipe in debug mode to show more logs in terminal
```

## Why open source?

Recent breakthroughs in AI have shown that context is the final frontier. AI will soon be able to incorporate the context of an entire human life into its 'prompt', and the technologies that enable this kind of personalisation should be available to all developers to accelerate access to the next stage of our evolution.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference with adept.ai and rewind.ai?</summary>

  - adept.ai is a closed product, focused on automation while we are open and focused on enabling tooling & infra for a wide range of applications like adept 
  - rewind.ai is a closed product, focused on a single use case (they only focus on meetings now), not customisable, your data is owned by them, and not extendable by developers 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Where is the data stored?</summary>
  
  - 100% of the data stay local in a SQLite database and mp4/mp3 files. You own your data
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you encrypt the data?</summary>
  
  - Not yet but we're working on it. We want to provide you the highest level of security.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can I customize capture settings to reduce storage and energy usage?</summary>
  
  - You can adjust frame rates and resolution in the configuration. Lower values will reduce storage and energy consumption. We're working on making this more user-friendly in future updates.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are some practical use cases for screenpipe?</summary>
  
    - RAG & question answering
    - Automation (write code somewhere else while watching you coding, write docs, fill your CRM, sync company's knowledge, etc.)
    - Analytics (track human performance, education, become aware of how you can improve, etc.)
    - etc.
    - We're constantly exploring new use cases and welcome community input!
